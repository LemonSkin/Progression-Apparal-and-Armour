# Progression: Apparel & Armour
It always bother me when I install mods like Medieval Overhaul or one of the old-timey Vanilla Factions Expanded that all of the medieval clothing appears in the same research projects as more modern clothing. This mod aims to correct that.

On its own, this mod doesn’t do a whole lot - it creates a new research project to unlock the hand tailor bench. It is intended that this mod be used with other mods that add medieval apparel and armour to the game.

* Added new research: Rustic clothing (400)
    * Rustic clothing > Complex clothing
* Moved hand tailoring bench to Rustic clothing research
* Moved the following to Rustic clothing:
    * Robe
    * Hood
    * Cape (if Royalty or Biotech installed)
* Flak armor requires Machining and Complex clothing - Modern combat armour doesn't have much in common with medieval plate armour
* The Plate armor research project now requires Rustic clothing instead of Complex clothing
* TODO: Steel simple helmet now requires Complex clothing

# Integrations
Generally, apparel and armour items have had their research requirements adjusted to make sense and to provide a deeper sense of progression. Items have also been rebalanced to give players more reasons to use them and to make fewer items clear winners in any given category.

Nudity settings have been tweaked where appropriate, mostly for headgear. Hats, helmets and masks that cover the majority of a pawn's head will count as clothing, while others do not.

## Royalty
* Modified research chains:
    * Rustic clothing > Noble apparel > Royal apparel
* Beret, Corset, Formal shirt, Formal vest, Ladies hat, and Top hat require Complex clothing + Noble apparel
* Royal apparel only requires Nobel apparel research (Rustic clothing is implicitly unlocked)
* Crown and Cornet also require Smithing
